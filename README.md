# Learn-VLSI(PD) With open-source EDA Tools
This respository of 5-day workshop is used to help the beginners to using open-source tools like below to get the base practical idea of the VLSI Physical Design- 


**Yosys** – for Synthesis <br/>
**Graywolf** – for Placement <br/>
**Qrouter** – for Routing <br/>
**Netgen** – for LVS <br/>
**Magic** – for Layout and Floorplanning <br/>
**Qflow** – RTL2GDS integration <br/>
**OpenSTA** & **Opentimer** -Pre-layout and Post-layout Static timing analysis <br/>

# Contents of Workshop 
**Day -1**: Study and Review Various components of RISC-V based PicoSoC <br/>
**Day -2**: Chip Planning Strategies and Introduction to Foundry Library Cells <br/>
**Day -3**: Design and Characterize one Library Cell using magic Layout Tool and ngspice<br/>
**Day -4**: Pre-Layout Timing Analysis and Importance of Good Clock Tree<br/>
